# HMM
Python3 Implementation of Hidden Markov Model

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.6 (Earlier version could be applicable.)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) (Only the function [sklearn.model_selection.KFold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) for splitting the training set is used.)

## Descriptions
The standard functions in a homogeneous multinomial hidden Markov model with discrete state spaces are implmented. The initial probability distribution, transition probability matrix, and emission probability matrix are stored in [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) arrays.
